            I love playing video games; I've been playing games since I was 13.
            I enjoy play because you can be a different persona through the
            characters.

            Art is meaningful to me. I can express myself through my art, and it
            is therapeutic.

            I build my own PC. It's interesting to see each pc piece work
            together.
